## About this manual

This document describes the new vocabulary server. Until version 24.06, vocabularies were part of Goobi Workflow and saved in Goobi's database. Since version 24.07, everything related to vocabularies moved to a stand-alone application, the vocabulary server. The vocabulary server requires its own database to store all its data and provides access to the vocabularies and records through a REST API. Goobi Workflow has been updated to use the new vocabulary server instead of its own, embedded vocabularies. If desired, the vocabulary server could be publicly available. If you already used vocabularies before, check out the migration guide in this documentation to transfer your data to the new vocabulary server.

The source code of UGH can be found on GitHub.
